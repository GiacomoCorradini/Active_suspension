# The dynamic model and control algorithm for the Active Suspension System

This project will analyse the aspects of passive and active suspensions for quarter car model and construct an active suspension control for a quarter car model
subject to excitation from a road profile

## Goals

Perform a comparison of the following controllers on the suspension system

- LQR controller
- PID controller
